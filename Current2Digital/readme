This is project related to data extraction from DDC112(TI) Current to digital converter via Opal Kelly FPGA board 
The verilog code consists of:
  - pipeout_test1.v - main file
    - FSM.v
      - CLKGEN.v
      - READOUT.v
    - DDC112_mock.v - for emulating the DDC112 behavior(needs to be uncommented in main file)
